Description: UniSport provides people a web interface where they can look for the current sport offerings of the university using a sophisticated search tool. They can also register for specific courses and instantly see where these courses are located on a map. Additionally there is contact page for asking questions and proposing things. The participants of the course get notification emails shortly before the course is taking place. There is also a faq page. There is an about us page showing the coaches and the administration team. Sometimes there are also special events and competitions available.

Minimal (absolutely necessary): sample data to test application; server, database and frontend running showing dummy page with content retrieved from database; basic string search; basic bootstrap boilerplate design on frontend;
Normal (should be possible): extended search (data and time, place, etc.); basic reservation tool (only provide name)
Optimal (possible if no problems occur): nice enhanced design; more elaborate reservation tool (with captcha, mail checking, etc.); showing place directly on map;
Nice to have (possible if there is additional time): get real data from university sports sites from bern, neuchatel and fribourg;
